2. Tasks will appear in the “To Do” section.
3. Mark a task as completed by tapping the circular icon.
4. Completed tasks will automatically move to the “Completed” section.
5. Delete tasks by swiping left on them.
6. If there are no pending or completed tasks, a message will appear indicating that there are no tasks.
